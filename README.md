## 🚀 About The Project

**CodeCraft** is an interactive, web-based playground built for developers who need to quickly test logic, prototype ideas, or share code snippets without spinning up a local development environment. 

Whether you're practicing algorithms, debugging a quick script, or collaborating with peers, CodeCraft provides a robust editor powered by Monaco (the engine behind VS Code), beautiful syntax highlighting, and a secure sandboxed runtime for instant output.
